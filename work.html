      <h3>Object Detection</h3>
      <p>In the Object Detection project, the first step is to break down the image into tiles. Then, you will use a
        pre-trained VGG-16 CNN to predict the probability of a cat being present in the image. Finally, you will create
        a heatmap of probabilities to indicate the location of the cat within the image. In order to provide a more
        accurate location for a bounding box, you must use a regression model to predict its coordinates.</p>

      <h3>Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting </h3>
      <p>Discover and explore stock market data, focusing on technology stocks such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and
        Microsoft in the Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting using the LSTM project.Learn how to retrieve stock
        information using the yfinance library and visualize it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. Analyze a stock's risk
        based on its previous performance history. Finally, build an AI model using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
        method to predict future stock prices.</p>

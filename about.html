    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Revo-AI, founded in January <i>2022</i> by <b>Dennis Mburugu, Elizabeth Weng, Samson William, Gregory Nitk,John
        Zaremba, and Wojciech Sutskever</b>, emerged with the mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence
      (AGI)
      benefits all of humanity. The company started as a non-profit research organization with a $1 billion endowment
      and
      a commitment to open collaboration, sharing its research findings openly with the world. Early on, Revo-AI focused
      on deep learning and reinforcement learning, rapidly gaining a reputation for groundbreaking research. Its first
      major milestone was the development of Revo-AI Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning
      algorithms, which became a staple in the AI research community.</p>
    <p>In <i>2018</i>, Revo-AI made headlines with the creation of the <b>Revo-AI Five</b>, a team of AI agents capable
      of
      playing the complex multiplayer video game Dota 2 at a competitive level. This project showcased the potential of
      reinforcement learning and neural networks in mastering intricate tasks traditionally thought to require human
      intuition and strategic thinking. The success of Revo-AI Five underscored the organization's prowess in AI
      research
      and its potential for practical applications, sparking further interest and investment in AI technologies. Around
      this time, Revo-AI also began exploring the ethical implications of AI, emphasizing the importance of safety and
      long-term societal impacts.</p>
